The Wolves Captioning Project

  <h4>
    Made by Charlotte Yang and Hayley Peterson
    </h4>
    <p>This simulated captioning system was created to aid the viewing of this particular product.
      The show centers around 9 highschool soccer players experiencing the trials associated with the highschool experience. What makes this play so difficult to caption is the fact that often the actors are speaking over one another or multiple conversations are occurring simultaneously.
      Likewise, because they are playing soccer, they are constantly cycling between stretching, dribbling and practicing.
      Our solution to this problem was to have each actor's lines appear above their head, following their movements.
