        <h1>The Wolves Captioning Project <img src="emoji.png" width=50px></h1>
      <h4>
        Made by Charlotte Yang and Hayley Peterson
        </h4>
        <p>This simulated captioning system was created to aid the viewing of this particular production.
          The show centers around 9 highschool soccer players at their weekly soccer games. What makes this play so difficult to caption is the fact that the actors are speaking over one another or multiple conversations are occurring simultaneously.
          Likewise, because they are playing soccer, they are constantly cycling between stretching, dribbling and running.
          Our solution to this problem was to have each actor's lines appear above their head, following their movements. Along with their lines, we also associated emojis to the emotions tied to their speech, to further caption the emotion that can't always be perceived just by reading the subtitles.
